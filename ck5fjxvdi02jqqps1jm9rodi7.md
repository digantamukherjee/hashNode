## 1. The big bang moment...

> "... it all started with a big bang"
# Why ECMAScript was conceived?

Prior to 1997 a scripting language was developed to enable some client side scripts to be executed in the browser Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995 known as  [LiveScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveScript), which was later renamed as  [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) when the browser was deployed in December. At the same time Microsoft was developing JScript.
This lead to a lot of non standardized ways in which browser scripting was being done.
Long story short.. a lot of major players jumped in with different implementations of a script for browsers and hence the need for standardization was felt and then in November 1996 Netscape submitted JavaScript to   [ECMA International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) based on which other browsers could implement their JS Engine.

So the 
ECMAScript : *"A general purpose, cross-platform programming language"* came into being.

### The First Edition - June 1997
The standardization and first edition of ECMAScript was available.

### The Second Edition - June 1998
The second edition of the script was made available also known as ECMA-262 which was basically an edited version of the first edition.

### The Third Edition - December 1999
The third edition was made available, and this time it came with some features that started shaping this scripting language. Some of the features were:
- Powerful regular expressions
- Better string handling
- New control statements
- Try/Catch Exception Handling mechanism
- More precise definitions of errors
- Numeric formatting capabilities


### No Fourth Edition !!! 
After the third edition was made available the world started to adapt to the ECMA standards and started implementing in the web browsers. A lot of work was done to develop a fourth edition, however the work was not completed and as a result the fourth edition was never published. However some of the features were used for developing the sixth edition.

### The Fifth Edition(5.1) or ES5 - June 2011
This added some interesting features:
- Accessor properties
- Reflective Creation
- Inspection of Objects
- Program Control of Property Attributes
- Additional array manipulation functions
- Support for JSON object encoding format
- *strict mode* that provides enhanced error check and security

### The Sixth Edition or ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 - June 2015
A lot of new features were added in this Edition:
- Constants
- Blocked scope variables and functions
- Arrow Functions
- Extended Parameter handling
- Template Literals
- Enhanced Regular Expressions
- Enhanced Object Properties
- Destructuring Assignment
- Modules
- Classes
- Symbol Types
- Iterators
- Generators
- Map/Set or WeakMap/WeakSet
- Typed Arrays
- New Built-In Methods
- Promises
- Meta-Programming
- Internationalization and Localization

### The Seventh Edition or ES7 or ECMAScript 2016 - June 2016
- Proper Tail Calls
- Exponentiation operators ```**```
- ```await``` , ```async``` for asynchronous programming
 

### The Eighth Edition or ES8 or ECMAScript 2017 - June 2017
- Includes features for concurrency and  [atomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability) 
- Syntactic Integration with promises(async/await)
- Shared Memory

### The Ninth Edition or ES9 or ECMAScript 2018 - June 2018
- Rest/spread operators for variables(three dots: ```...identifier```)
- Asynchronous Iteration
- ```Promise.prototype.finally()```
- Additions to Regular Expressions

### The Tenth Edition or ES10 or ECMAScript 2019 - June 2019
Some of the new features are:
- ```Array.prototype.flat```
- ```Array.prototype.flatMap```
- ```Array.sort```
- ```Object.fromEntries```
- ```trimStart``` and ```trimEnd``` on ```String.prototype```
- allowing U+2028 (LINE SEPARATOR) and U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR) in string literals to align with JSON
- ```Function.prototype.toString```

Implementation of a lot of these features are still in experimental phase and are not a 100% functional in all the browsers or JavaScript run-time environments. Check  [here](https://caniuse.com/#cats=JS) for references. 
As is evident from this evolution and additions to the ECMAScript standards, this is no more a mere Scripting Language but a full scale programming language.

And not only is JavaScript(the most popular and widely used implementation of ECMAScript specifications) used for client side scripting with client side frameworks like  [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) ,  [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) ,  [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and many more in the World Wide Web, but it is also a very popular choice for Service Side scripting, thanks to  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) !

So this is how it all began !!! Let us go through  a  [basic overview of ECMAScript/JS](https://diganta.hashnode.dev/2-ecmascript-overview-ck5fqhk1g02n5qps1dq0o72yv)
